Quote App Generator is a simple web application that provides user with random inspirational quotes on the user's command.
It actually grabs the random inspirational quotes from a API and destructures the compound value to get the quote and display it properly on the screen.
It uses React JS and CSS for its styling and functionality and implements Axios in React JS to connect to the API and retrieve the compound data.

How to run the Program: Just download the contents from the github and paste it on a directory. While in the directory open the terminal and run the code "npm start". This will boot start the web application.
